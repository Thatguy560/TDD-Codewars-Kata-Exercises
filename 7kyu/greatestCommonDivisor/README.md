## Greatest common divisor

### Requirements 

Find the greatest common divisor of two positive integers. The integers can be large, so you need to find a clever solution.

The inputs x and y are always greater or equal to 1, so the greatest common divisor will always be an integer that is also greater or equal to 1.

### Test Cases

```JavaScript
mygcd(30,12),6
mygcd(8,9),1
```
