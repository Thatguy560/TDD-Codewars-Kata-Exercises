## Get the integers between two numbers Kata

### Requirements 

Build a function that can get all the integers between two given numbers.

Example:

(2,9)

Should give you this output back:

[ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ]

If startNum is the same as endNum, return an empty array.

### Test Cases

```Javascript
range(2,9),[3,4,5,6,7,8]
range(6,8),[7]
```

| Input                                          | Output |
| :--------------------------------------------- | :----- |
| 2,9                           | [3,4,5,6,7,8]  |
