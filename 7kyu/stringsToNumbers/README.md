## Strings to numbers Kata

### Requirements 

You are given an array of numbers in string form. Your task is to convert this to an array of numbers.

Your function can only be a maximum of 30 characters long (not including whitespaces)! I have limited the char count because there is a very short and easy way to achieve this task.

### Test Cases

```
Convert(['1','2','3'] # => [1,2,3])
```

### Input/Output Table

| Input             | Output             |
| :---------------- | :----------------- |
| ["1","2","3"]     | [1, 2, 3,          |
